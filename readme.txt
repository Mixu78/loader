java video game hack loader 

known issue:
this loader automatically
elevates the dll to ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES,
the way we do this is by looking up the principal
group name. in non-english versions of windows, this causes
an issue because ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES is named something else.

u need:
